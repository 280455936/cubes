Cubes 2.0 release notes
***********************

Moved to Python 3.6.

* SQL Alchemy is now required dependency, as the focus is now SQL query
  generator.

Overview
========

Major change is full move to Python 3.6 and dropping compatibility with lesser
versions of Python.


Naming Conventions
==================

The naming conventions were moved from the ``[server]`` section of the config
file and moved to a separate ``[naming]`` section.


Migration from 1.x to 2.0
=========================


Model Changes:

* All joins in the model must be specified as dictionaries, not as tuples


Configuration Changes:

* Naming conventions (dimension prefix, fact prefix, etc.) should be moved from
  the ``[server]`` to the ``[naming]`` section
* There must be no unknown configuration settings in the `.ini` file that are
  not recognized by the library. (Note: If you think the option should be
  accepted, please file an issue in the Cubes issue tracker)
